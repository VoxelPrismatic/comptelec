do yourself a favor and buy an actually decent iron if you dont have one already

i recommend the [pinecil](pine64.org/pinecil) from pine64, i bought one but unfortunately i did all the
soldering thus far with the spoon

okay, i really recommend not using those 'firesticks' which plug straight into the wall with no temp adjust 
or anything.
if you do have one of those, just buy a pinecil, it's only $25. [the ts100 is like double the price]

sorry for the slow updates, i need to take pics and document everything, im too lazy

if you want me to post more, star the repo or DM me on discord @ `PRIZ ;]#9244` and then ill update this. 
in the meantime ill just be taking photos, not documenting.

good luck!
